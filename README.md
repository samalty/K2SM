# K2SocialMedia.co.uk

This is a static website built to help promote services provided by K2SocialMedia, including social media consultancy, content 
and training courses. This site was developed using a mobile-first approach, and the client's instructions concerning the design 
of the site were strictly adhered to throughout development.

## Technologies used

- Javascript: Javascript was used to create certain dynamic elements throughout the website, including controlling the visibility 
of the 'scroll to top' button, and updating the appearance of certain elements when opened and closed.
- jQuery: Much of the javascript logic was simplified using jQuery, including control of the navbar dropdown options, the expanding 
answers in the FAQs section, and the scroll to top button functionality.
- HTML: HTML was used to structure the website.
- CSS: The appearance of the website was enhanced using CSS. This website was designed from scratch, and doesn't include the use of 
any CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap.

## Deployment

This website is live at: https://www.k2socialmedia.co.uk/

*Update: This website has since been updated by another developer. Consequently, this source code will not entirely reflect the live 
version. Updates have also unfortunately offset a number of elements that I had specifically designed with mobile users in mind.
